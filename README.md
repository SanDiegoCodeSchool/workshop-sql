# SQL Workshop



## Overview
Many of the things that we do on our computer involve some sort of data stored somewhere in a database. Whether you are a Software Engineer, Aspiring Data Scientist, or simply a DIY computer enthusiast, learning how to interact with data is a fantastic foundational skill that will make you a more well rounded computer user and add value to your resume. There are several languages and tools that can help you accomplish this and this workshop will focus on the most popular, SQL (Structured Query Language). Mastering SQL can take a lifetime, so our hope with todayâ€™s workshop is to give you a foundational understanding of querying existing data so that you can continue to practice and learn on your own. 



## Learning objectives
This SQL lesson aims to accomplish three key tasks. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define and implement the key terminology used when talking about data i.e. database, table, record, etc.
- Write your own basic SQL Queries to extract, manipulate, and aggregate data in a database.
- Identify how to continue learning SQL through exposure to popular tools and resources that you can use to continue learning. 



## Prerequisites
In order to be succesful in this workshop, you will need:
- A computer and an internet browser (preferrably Google Chrome or Firefox)
- An account for [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
- A desire to learn and a willingness to step outside your comfort zone



## How to use this repo

#### Using Gitpod
This repo is designed to use the [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io) system for environment consistency. Using docker containers, GitPod ensures that the workshop will behave the same way on any machine, regardless of operating system and other software versions. [Click here to spin up the GitPod envinronment!](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/SanDiegoCodeSchool/workshop-sql)

#### Contents
 - Data: The folder with our SQL scripts. These create and fill the example databases that we use throughout this repo. **If you wish to use this repo outside of the GitPod platform, you will need to run the scripts in this folder using your preferred SQL client. Find the relevant scripts and run the schema script followed by the data script. The workshop notes assume `MySQL` i.e.

 ```bash
mysql -u root < data/sakila-schema.sql
mysql -u root < data/sakila-data.sql
 ```
