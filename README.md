___

## Overview
Many of the things that we do on our computer involve some sort of data stored somewhere in a database. Whether you are a Software Engineer, Aspiring Data Scientist, or simply a DIY computer enthusiast, learning how to interact with data is a fantastic foundational skill that will make you a more well rounded computer user and add value to your resume. There are several languages and tools that can help you accomplish this and we will focus on the most popular, SQL (Structured Query Language). Mastering SQL can take a lifetime, so our hope with todayâ€™s workshop is to give you a foundational understanding of querying existing data so that you can continue to practice and learn on your own. 


## Learning objectives
This SQL lesson aims to accomplish three key tasks. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define and implement the key terminology used when talking about data i.e. database, table, record, etc.
- Write your own basic SQL Queries to extract, manipulate, and aggregate data in a database.
- Identify how to continue learning SQL through exposure to popular tools and resources that you can use to continue learning.
